It will ignore other players and only pay attention to its target. However, if the target is outside the building, it can hunt like any other ghost and kill whoever it sees.\r\n\r\n      When a Banshee uses its ghost ability, it will navigate to a location near its target and attempt to start a Hunt, regardless of average Sanity. For 20 seconds, if it sees its chosen target for long enough, it will initiate a hunt, otherwise it will return to the room it spawned in. It is unclear if these 20 seconds pass while the Banshee is navigating to the location near its target, or if it only starts when it has reached the location.[1][verify] As such, a Banshee may wander far from its ghost room when attempting to hunt its target. Banshees will also initiate hunts like most other ghosts if the average sanity is less than 50%, but can also use its ability under this condition.\r\n      \r\n      Although the Banshee's ability theoretically allows it to hunt at any time, in practice, the successful use of this ability is very rare.\r\n      \r\n      If a Banshee hunts with its target inside the building, the Banshee will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it will ignore all players other than its target. It will not attempt to chase other players and will not kill them, even if they come into contact with the players. The Banshee will still react to Smudge Sticks lit by other players, but this will not allow for completion of the \"Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone\" optional Objective, unless the Banshee is also chasing the target.\r\n      \r\n      If a Banshee begins a Hunt while its target is outside the building, the Banshee will act according to standard hunt rules with respect to all players, and will kill any player it catches.\r\n      \r\n      The Banshee selects a new target when their previous one dies or leaves the game, choosing the first non-dead player in the list.[verify]\r\n      \r\n      A crucifix has an effective range of 5 meters instead of 3 meters against a Banshee; a Hunt will fail to start if the Banshee is within this radius and the Crucifix has not been completely used up.
