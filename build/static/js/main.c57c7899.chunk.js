It will ignore other players and only pay attention to its target. However, if the target is outside the building, it can hunt like any other ghost and kill whoever it sees.\n\n      When a Banshee uses its ghost ability, it will navigate to a location near its target and attempt to start a Hunt, regardless of average Sanity. For 20 seconds, if it sees its chosen target for long enough, it will initiate a hunt, otherwise it will return to the room it spawned in. It is unclear if these 20 seconds pass while the Banshee is navigating to the location near its target, or if it only starts when it has reached the location.[1][verify] As such, a Banshee may wander far from its ghost room when attempting to hunt its target. Banshees will also initiate hunts like most other ghosts if the average sanity is less than 50%, but can also use its ability under this condition.\n      \n      Although the Banshee\'s ability theoretically allows it to hunt at any time, in practice, the successful use of this ability is very rare.\n      \n      If a Banshee hunts with its target inside the building, the Banshee will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it will ignore all players other than its target. It will not attempt to chase other players and will not kill them, even if they come into contact with the players. The Banshee will still react to Smudge Sticks lit by other players, but this will not allow for completion of the "Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone" optional Objective, unless the Banshee is also chasing the target.\n      \n      If a Banshee begins a Hunt while its target is outside the building, the Banshee will act according to standard hunt rules with respect to all players, and will kill any player it catches.\n      \n      The Banshee selects a new target when their previous one dies or leaves the game, choosing the first non-dead player in the list.[verify]\n      \n      A crucifix has an effective range of 5 meters instead of 3 meters against a Banshee; a Hunt will fail to start if the Banshee is within this radius and the Crucifix has not been completely used up.

For example, a Demon will on average have the same chance of hunting if the average team sanity is 60%, versus the chance that a Spirit will hunt with an average team sanity of 40%. In fact, below an average team sanity of 25%, there is no difference in the average hunting rate between Demons and most other ghosts. This does not mean that investigation and completion of objectives is not more challenging, however, as there will be less time to collect evidence and perform such objectives before the first hunt starts.\n      \n      If a Demon answers a question asked towards an Ouija Board, the player who asked the question will have a sanity drop of 40% instead of the usual 50%.

They moved at about 1.8 m/s in cold rooms and about 1 m/s in warm rooms.

If the fuse box is not turned on, it cannot use either ability.

This can be used to accurately identify the Ghost as an Obake.\n\n      When a fingerprint is imprinted, there is also a separate chance for it to disappear in 1 minute, instead of the usual 2 minutes.\n      \n      Obake will not morph into a player model, nor do they have a unique ghost model that they can morph into, nor does it change models between manifestations and Hunts.

Similar to the Yokai, whose hunt sanity threshold is raised to 80% while players are talking near it, the Onryo's hunt threshold is higher[verify] than the default 50% of other ghosts while there are no sources of fire nearby. When this is negated by a lit Candle, Lighter, or Campfire, its threshold is the normal 50%.[1] However, having a lit flame for this purpose also risks triggering an early hunt if the flame goes out.\n      \n      The Onryo also has a higher chance to blow out a flame than other ghosts, further complicating the task of countering one.\n      \n      Contrary to the Journal quote, the Onryo does not attempt to escape from lit candles, nor does an open flame reduce the Onryo's normal hunt chance."},{id:11,name:"Phantom",evidences:[1,3,7],className:"ghost",behavior:"When a Phantom uses its power, it will navigate to a random player's location, creating an Interaction EMF at its starting location.\n\n      If a photo is a taken of a Phantom, it will disappear temporarily for a certain amount of time.

The Raiju can hunt between 60-70% insanity as long as there are electronics around it.\n      \n      There is also a sure way to know whether the Ghost is a Raiju by looking at its model during Hunts.

This wandering Twin cannot set off motion sensors, and cannot respond to the Spirit Box nor spread Freezing Temperatures, but its interactions may give off EMF Level 5.\n\n      When the ghost attempts to initiate a Hunt, there is a 50% chance for it to begin at the "main" Twin, and a 50% chance for it to begin at the Twin that last interacted with the environment.
